In order to augment the statistical analyses that can be performed within i2b2, we decided to rely on the R software. R is currently the most powerful free statistical environment, available in source code form under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License. R is constantly expanded via packages and it contains a very wide set of statistical tools particularly interesting for biomedical research. We thus created a novel cell named R Engine Cell (RE Cell) that allows the communication between the i2b2 architecture and the R software. As first target, we have first concentrated on making Kaplan Meier analyses available within i2b2 web interface. To this aim we developed a plug-in that allows users to easily select the patient set on which to perform the analysis and displays the results in a graphical, intuitive way.
